Considers now null geodesics in Schwarzschild, on the equatorial plane, and using perturbation theory
Expansion in small \rho = R/\sqrt{L}, where R = 2M, L = angular momentum = r^2 \phi'

Radial relation integrable:

d\lambda / d r = F(E, L, r, R)

dimensionless variables:

 x = r/\sqrt{L}
 
scales:

	\hat r = \sqrt{L}
	\hat t = \hat r
	
dimensionless parameters

	\rho = R/\hat r
	\epsilon = E/\hat r	 
	
Integrating the relation \lambda = \lambda (x)

Problems with initial data: relation between x_\calO and conserved quantities E, L, m involves \rho.

also equations for 



-------

to do:

1.
\lambda = \int_{r_O)^r dr \Lambda(E,L,m^2,r) dr
\phi = \int_{r_O}^r dr \Phi(E,L,m^2,r) dr + \phi_O
t = \inz_{r_O}^r dr T(E,L,m^2,r) dr + t_O

Unknown functions \Lambda, \Phi, T.

E=E(x_0,x_O')
L=L(x_0,x_O')
m^2=m^2(x_O,x_O')
known conserved quantities

try to calculate the variations
 \delta r = (...) \delta E + (...) \delta L + (...) \delta m^2 + (...) \delta \lambda
 \delta \phi =  (...) \delta E + (...) \delta L + (...) \delta m^2 + \delta\phi_O + (...) \delta \lambda
  \delta t =  (...) \delta E + (...) \delta L + (...) \delta m^2 + \delta t_O + (...) \delta \lambda
  
  with coefficients (...) being integrals over r or functions of the initial data or the endpoint.
  
  then substitute the variations of the consderved quantities in terms of the variations of the initial data
  
  then express :\delta r, \delta \phi, \delta t by the variations of initial data and \lambda
  
2. 
	think of another variable for integration (\phi or t instead of r)
	
3. 
   when can you invert the relation between E, L, m^2, initial point and the initial tangent vector????
   
4.
  what if we allow motion outside the equatorial plane?
  (vector \vec L????)
